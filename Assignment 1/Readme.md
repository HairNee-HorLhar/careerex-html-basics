# 🌐 My First Webpage  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **CareerEx backend development program** assignment. The goal is to build a simple **HTML and CSS** webpage to practice frontend basics before diving deeper into backend technologies.  

Through this project, I am learning:

## 🎯 Features

- **Paragraphs (`<p>`)** introducing myself and my learning experience  
- **Local & Online Images (`<img>`)** to add visual content  
- **"About Me" Section** describing my background  
- **"My Favorite Things" Section** with images and descriptions  
- **CSS Styling (`css/index.css`)** to improve the design  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
